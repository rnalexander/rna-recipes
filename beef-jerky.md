#Beef Jerky

##Short version
Pretty much Alton Brown's recipe here:  http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe.html
Except I used my oven instead of a box-fan and air filters. (also I didn't have liquid smoke so I used smoked sea salt, which I balanced out with a bit of water)

##Recipie

###Ingredients
- 1kg beef, brisket or top round but basically a cheap cut, no need to go big on this
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce
- few dashes of tabasco
- 2 tbs maple syrup/brown sugar/agave nectar/honey
- 2 tbs garlic powder
- 2 tbs onion powder
- 2 tbs smoked sea salt
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper
- red pepper flakes (I use maybe 1tsp, but I'm less fond of that fire than others.)

###Insturctions
- Mix all of the ingredients except the beef together in bowl to make the marinade, stir to get them all combined.
- Trim any excess fat from the meat
- Cut the meat into thin strips 5mm thick or less, cut across the grain (if you put the meat in the freezer for an hour or so it will be stiffer and easier to make thinner cuts on)
- Place the strips into the marinade (a ziplog bag works really well for this, push all of the air out to make sure that all of the meat is in contact with the marinade)
- Place marinading beef into the fridge and leave to sit at least overnight, although longer is fine.
- Once the beef is well marinaded, drain the marinade (a collander works well for this)
- line the bottom of your oven with foil, or place a tray on the bottom to catch any drips.
- place the beef in separated strips (not touching) on the oven racks
- turn the oven on to the very lowest setting
- prop open the door with a wodden spoon
- point a fan at the cracked open oven door for extra convection
- leave it alone for about 8 hours
- remove strips that look good an finished, leave the thicker ones in for a while longer if they need it
- nom the tasty jerky with your face
